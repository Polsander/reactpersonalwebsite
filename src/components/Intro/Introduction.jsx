                                Hi there, and welcome to my website! My Name is Oliver, and I am a 2nd year student
                                shortly going into my 3rd year at the <b>University of Waterloo</b> where I am studying
                                <b> chemical engineering</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am a very curious in general, and put a lot of effort into learning things that interest me (like coding and web development).
                                Trying new things and taking on challenges is my philosophy on how I can grow and become the best individual I can be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On my free time I love playing the guitar ðŸŽ¸,<br></br>
                                Officiating High-Level Baseball âš¾, <br />
                                And (to no surprise) playing video games ðŸŽ®.
